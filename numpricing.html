  <h1>What is financial derivative?</h1>
  <div style="background-color:#F5F5F5;color:black;padding:20px;">
  <p>A derivative is a contract between two or more parties whose value is based on an agreed-upon underlying financial asset (like a security) or set of assets (like an index). Common underlying instruments include bonds, commodities, currencies, interest rates, market indexes and stocks.</p>
  <p>Derivatives can be used for several purposes, including insuring against price movements (hedging), increasing exposure to price movements for speculation or getting access to otherwise hard-to-trade assets or markets. Generally, derivatives are used to scatter the risks which is contained in the transactions and operating businesses.</p>
  <p>They are now becoming increasingly vital for the market and the society as a part of the financial market, a sensible way to combine computing and derivatives will be of potentiality.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>How are the prices of the financial derivatives determined?</h1>
  <div style="background-color:#F5F5F5;color:black;padding:20px;">
  <p>Typical financial derivatives such as futures and options are used to describe the goods and services which have not been generated and produced yet, so it can possibly be simplified to be guaranteed transactions made in the future.</p>
  <p>Futures contracts (futures) are financial contracts to purchase or sell a certain kind of good or service in the future. Therefore, the value of which will be based on the commodity's market price. For example, assume that the chair futures contract that represents 1,000 sets of chairs. If a set of chairs are trading at a price of 3 units of a currency, the value of the contract is 3,000 units of a currency. Futures contracts are standardized to include a certain amount and quality of the underlying commodity, so they can be traded on a centralized exchange. The futures price moves in relation to the spot price for the commodity based on supply and demand for that commodity.</p>
  <p>Options on stocks and exchange-traded funds are also common derivative contracts. Options give the buyer the right, compared to the obligation that is contained in the future contracts. The best-known pricing model for options is the Black-Scholes method. (Black-Scholes is a pricing model used to determine the fair price or theoretical value for a call or a put option based on six variables such as volatility, type of option, underlying stock price, time, strike price, and risk-free rate), which is formed by the basic formula of Call Option Premium C = SN(d1) - Xe- rt N(d2), Put Option Premium P = Xe-rT N (-d2) - S0 N (-d1), in which call stands for the right to purchase whereas put means the right to sell.</p>

  <h1>Influences that has been brought by the computer software.</h1>
  <div style="background-color:#F5F5F5;color:black;padding:20px;">
  <p>Regardless the obvious prices for the goods and services, a huge number of factors is crucial to ensure the precision of the numerical outcome. The dynamic digits of elements like exchange rates, interest rates and the prospects of firms are undoubtedly crucial. However, all these factors will make the predictions extremely sophisticated, it is no longer as simple as just a calculation, therefore the role in which computer plays is to visualised the pricing processes and to make the prediction as modulus as possible (to make it easier to predict).</p>
  <p>A platform for pricing financial derivatives called premia is a perfect example of using software as a tool. In this platform, they made it very fragmentary to use it, by this what I really meant is that the only steps to forecast the value is to simply fill in the numbers which contain values like exchange rate, interest rate and the amount of debt of a business. Name all the current conditions as figures and substitute them into existing formulas is the basic and essential principles behind these calculators.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Links to hedging/hedge fund.</h1>
  <div style="background-color:#F5F5F5;color:black;padding:20px;">
  <p>Although being slightly different to typical cases, hedging is often brought together with financial derivatives. It just simply indicates a way to offset the potential risks by carrying out the opposite action; for instance, to reduce the impacts brought by the decreasing exchange rates, MNCs (multi-national corporations) usually purchase the counter currency (the currency of whom they are trading with) in advance. To accurately estimate the specific action which is needed to be carried out, a chain of calculation and predictions are essential. For the same reason with pricing the typical financial derivatives, simplifications are necessary to make the process workable.</p>
  </div>

  <h1>Contributions from UCL.</h1>
  <div style="background-color:#F5F5F5;color:black;padding:20px;">
  <p>Studying in UCL indicates the possibility of making references from other departments. Owing to the strong academic power of UCLâ€™s economics/statistics departments, it makes students in UCL extremely easy to get access to resources to carry out courses like financial risk managements. Learning the way of calculating the actual value of financial derivatives needs the constructions of numerical models and formulas to predict the value accurately, therefore being able to take advantages on these advanced knowledges means that the skills of prediction is highly reliable.</p>
